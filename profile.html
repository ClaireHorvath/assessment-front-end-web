    <ul class="'About Me">
        <li>Good listener</li>
        <p>I studied psychology previously so good and effective communication is very important to me, as well as being a good, active listener to others.</p>
        <li>Interested in fitness and nutrition</li>
        <p>I am very into eating healthy, particularly keto foods, as well as working out AT LEAST once a day.</p>
        <li>Aspiring java developer</li>
        <p>I love working on the back end of software engineer, I'm not interested in making it look good, I want to make sure the foundation is solid and that good security measures are in place.</p>
